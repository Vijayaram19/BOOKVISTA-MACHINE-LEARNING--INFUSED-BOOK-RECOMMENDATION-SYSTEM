# Book Recommendation System Using KNN

## Overview
The Book Recommendation System is an intelligent application designed to recommend books to users based on their preferences and the similarities with other books. Utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, this system provides personalized book recommendations, enhancing users' reading experiences by introducing them to books aligned with their interests.

## Features
- Personalized book recommendations based on user preferences and book similarities.
- Utilization of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for accurate matching.
- Dataset analysis and preprocessing for optimal performance.
- Feature scaling with MinMaxScaler to normalize data.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- google colab
- Python

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
